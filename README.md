# Chatbot Project using Hugging Face and Flask

This project implements a conversational AI chatbot using Hugging Face's **Transformers** library and a web interface built with **Flask**. The chatbot leverages pre-trained language models to generate responses to user inputs in real-time.

## Project Overview

- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Used to load pre-trained models that handle natural language understanding and generation.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework used to create the backend and deploy the chatbot as a web service.
  
The goal of this project is to create a responsive chatbot that can interact with users via a web interface.

## Features

- Real-time chatbot interaction via a Flask web application.
- Uses state-of-the-art pre-trained models from Hugging Face.
- Simple and intuitive web interface for user interaction.
